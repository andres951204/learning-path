# Data types

### Primitive

Are simple, can hold a **single** value.

- undefined
- string
- number
- boolean
- symbol

### Non-primitive

Are complex, can hold multiple values and methods.

> ### Useful notes
>
> 1.  All objects in JavaScript are passed by reference and all primitive types are passed by value
> 2.  In JavaScript, variables don't have types, values do.
